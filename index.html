          <p class="heading"># Basic yeast dough</p>
          <a class="comment"> > Usable for bread rolls üçû and pizza dough üçï, also sweets if that's your style</a>
          <p>
            What you need:<br>
            - flour (wheat, spilt, whole, any kind really) around 1000 grams<br>
            - water around 400 ml<br>
            - yeast (dry or active)<br>
            - salt
          </p>
          <p>
            Begin with mixing 200g of flour with the yeast, and heavy salt the mix (~30g).
            Pour water to the mix until everything is well homogenous, the mixture should be quite liquidy.<br>
            <a class="comment"> > Let it sit for around 10 min.</a><br>
            Then add a handful of flour and quirl until it's all one liquid again.
            Rinse and repeat as long as the dough sticks to the inside of your bowl.<br>
            The structure of the dough should be really soft, deform with minimal pressure, not sticky on the outside, but as soon as you're using more force on it's surface.<br>
            <a class="commment"> > Let it sit again for around one hour.</a><br>
            Get the dough out of the bowl, and knead with your hands until the dough get's a bit warmer. After that cut the dough into pieces if required and put it into the fridge for atleast 30 mins. After that it is ready to use.<br>

            <a class="comment"> > You can use the dough for about 2 days when you store it in the fridge.
