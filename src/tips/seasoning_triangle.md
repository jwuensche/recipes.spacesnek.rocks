# Seasoning Triangle

You can very roughly summarize the foundation for a well seasoned dish into 3 parts.

```dot process
graph {
    bgcolor="transparent"

    "Sweet" -- "Salty"
    "Sweet" -- "Acidic"
    "Acidic" -- "Salty"
    
    { rank=same; "Salty", "Acidic" }
}
```

Keeping them in balance is vital to get this wholesome roundness and
deliciousness feeling when taking the first bite of a dish.

While these are not the only components of the meal you can orient your
seasoning in these categories and get a rough estimation of what you should add
to make you dishes more tasty. For example, when trying to get more umaminess
into your food you may add miso, but take care that the saltiness of whatever
you are cooking is still at an acceptable level.
